### Singular Value Decomposition
This is a demonstration of Singular Value Decomposition used to assess patterns in the voting concordance of the Supreme Court Justices on non-unanimous cases from 2022-2023.
The inspiration for this was from the Politico article * Using Math to Analyze the Supreme Court Reveals an Intriguing Pattern * published in June 2024.
