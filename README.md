### Singular Value Decomposition
This is a demonstration of Singular Value Decomposition used to assess patterns in the voting concordance of the Supreme Court Justices on non-unanimous cases from 2022-2023.
The inspiration for this was from the [Politico article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/06/02/supreme-court-justice-math-00152188) **Using Math to Analyze the Supreme Court Reveals an Intriguing Pattern** published in June 2024.
